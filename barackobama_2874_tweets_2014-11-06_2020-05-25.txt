On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but it’s even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19.

The way they lived, in service to one another, should be our roadmap in the months ahead. https://t.co/S0sqvuicm8ßAnd here’s more on the approach Sweden has taken, which differs from some of its neighbors: 

https://t.co/Qw5R0O5RhMßSouth Korea has focused on testing to guard against outbreaks:

https://t.co/51h11Pb3HZßAs all 50 states begin the process of reopening, here are three articles that offer some lessons from other countries about the tradeoffs and policies involved. First, here’s what European nations have done to support workers:

https://t.co/OXJMUaFDKoßThe Class of 2020 is full of the leaders we need to bend the arc of history toward a better future—and our HBCU grads have the talent, skills, and vision to lead that change. I couldn't be prouder of all of you. https://t.co/Qlr5ivBvpJßAs Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. It’s one of the things I love most about the city—and one of the many reasons it’s such a good home for the @ObamaFoundation. https://t.co/ALo7kusc8KßCongrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who’ve guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! https://t.co/RjYvHs2BhCßCongratulations to the HBCU Class of 2020! Michelle and I are so proud of you. As you set out to change the world, we’ll be the wind at your back. Can’t wait to see what you achieve. https://t.co/PCsjkJJTXißGraduating is a big achievement no matter what, but with all that the Class of 2020 has dealt with to get across the finish line, I think they’ve earned a little celebration. I hope you’ll all join me in honoring them at 2PM ET and 8PM ET. https://t.co/dBK5nll7w8ßVote.ßMichelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so we’re reading “The Word Collector” for @chipublib. It’s a fun book that vividly illustrates the transformative power of words––and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. https://t.co/ADYbL6Dzg4ßDespite all the time that’s been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now.
https://t.co/pfokyI8GiBßChange comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, we’re already creating something better for tomorrow. https://t.co/9ScwPruoyAßEven if you can’t give the moms in your life a hug today, I hope you can give them an extra thank you today. Thank you and Happy Mother’s Day to the woman who makes it all possible. Love you, @michelleobama. https://t.co/E9ebxaSBpyßThere’s no limit to the devotion I’ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldn’t be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. https://t.co/xYECcrAxdEßI’ve always loved joining commencements––the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we can’t get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. https://t.co/ngR2ykx3A2ßThe folks of the Chicago @fooddepository—and food banks in communities like yours—are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who’ve fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. https://t.co/kSdijlyHLHßThe pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22ZeßIn moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. https://t.co/JkaBWYejKhßThis pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all. https://t.co/9dsedZYt0EßIf we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQRßWhile we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vUßWe've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. https://t.co/uNueQl5bNXßParents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.) https://t.co/Pmz8kRNMBCßProud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other––as neighbors and as citizens. https://t.co/DjnC1F9ph7ßWhen I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. https://t.co/pftk4JkhKQßDemocracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. https://t.co/qnLcR3mh8AßFor all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals – now’s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at https://t.co/Kboaxi3MVL. And I’ll see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can.ßI’m proud to endorse my friend @JoeBiden for President of the United States. Let's go: https://t.co/maHVGRozkXßDreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship—as they are Americans in every way but on paper. https://t.co/e4IYqX3WIyßWe can't deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It's a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions.
https://t.co/aipc8p7HwhßAlthough our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope––a reminder of rebirth and renewal––and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. https://t.co/xEsgxOarQ5ßLet’s not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. https://t.co/aTNxRV4Ws3ßEveryone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. https://t.co/gL38DpYEmußNo one should be forced to choose between their right to vote and their right to stay healthy like the debacle in Wisconsin this week. https://t.co/fbDCbOb9qNßSome good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. It’s critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. https://t.co/56RgGeAfr7ßMayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and they’ll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work. https://t.co/YzqPMPo8m2ßThrough centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people––and all of humanity––of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually.ßSocial distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring – something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReBßMy advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I’ve turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world. https://t.co/6bQski6N23ßIt’s World Health Day, and we owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our medical professionals. They’re still giving their all for us every day, at great risk to themselves, and we can’t thank them enough for their bravery and their service.ßBill Withers was a true American master. His music, rooted in the everyday joys and sorrows of working people, was soulful, wise and life-affirming––a perfect tonic for hard times. https://t.co/P8cusIny4kßAs she often does, @SenWarren provides a cogent summary of how federal policymakers should be thinking about the pandemic in the coming months. https://t.co/zkX0E7ncK5ßIt's Census Day and we all have a crucial role to play. Filling out the 2020 Census determines what the next decade will look like for your community: your roads, health care, schools, representation and more. Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. https://t.co/KzxFJKavmMßWe've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. https://t.co/K8Ucu7iVDKßSo many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. https://t.co/K8Pvp9CyaqßWe are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started—that journey to justice.ßWhat a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, “We ain’t going back. We’ve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.”ßRev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/xxjY2habOmßDuring this crisis, our grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, transit and utility workers—along with so many others—have been selflessly getting up every day to make sure we have the things we need. And for that, we say thank you.
https://t.co/Fq5qIRXt03ßAnd this article provides a great example of the kind of community spirit that we need to get through this—a spirit that we can hopefully learn to instill more of into our lives, workplaces, civic institutions, and government once the crisis has passed. https://t.co/xYZvspW4UgßHere’s a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. https://t.co/uYpP1KfOUsßThese are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake—for theirs. https://t.co/bwNXhOPMYsßOur medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home. https://t.co/ah7vva9776ßHere’s a useful summary of the current best thinking among public health experts on how we need to approach the fight against COVID-19 in the coming weeks. https://t.co/7cy71sKLVGßTen years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. https://t.co/zz2v3DzMgqßSometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid.ßAnd @cripchick, a disabled activist, understands what it’s like for people with particular vulnerabilities to come together for support:
https://t.co/aBAuBoMYFmß.@sullydish witnessed the impact of HIV-AIDS on the LGBT community in the early stages of that devastating disease: https://t.co/j0ipIrzoDCßHere are a few stories that have less to do with the very real medical or economic aspects of this crisis, and more with how we take care of each other as a human family during all crises:ßThe best part of my job was meeting people like this—ready to make a selfless act in a time of need. Many Americans are already making deep sacrifices to keep our communities healthy, but if you’re able to, consider helping those hit the hardest. https://t.co/CdrMsC6VXFß.@rgay and @SheaSerrano are using their feeds to directly support people in need—and helping shift our ideas about how to approach giving.
https://t.co/1JHPUYEiKVßIn my old neighborhood, the @BSAllianceChi established a crisis pantry to provide food and essential items for particularly vulnerable queer and trans residents on the South and West sides of Chicago.
https://t.co/ilyDlj3agoß.@ObamaFoundation Fellow @alexsmith1982 is helping seniors fight loneliness in the UK through a mix of new and old technology: online chats through Zoom and Skype, and postcards and poems shared by younger neighbors.
https://t.co/GdnqDR8JJ4ßSome great stories of big-hearted people coming up with new ways to come together—even while remaining apart—to help the vulnerable who face some very tough times ahead.
https://t.co/kcBQK915joßIn the meantime, remember to check up by phone on elderly or vulnerable friends and neighbors who may need our help.ßAs communities have begun to recognize the importance of social distancing measures to “flatten the curve” on COVID-19 transmission, here’s a sober but useful primer on what we should expect in the coming months: https://t.co/9oqdRF5J0QßWe owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody who’ll be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while. They’re giving everything. May we all model our own behavior on their selflessness and sacrifice as we help each other through this. https://t.co/F3tsJTqd4cßNot everybody can stay home, and we owe a big debt of gratitude to health professionals, transit and airport workers, first responders, and everyone keeping our communities going. Leaders have to step up to support people whose lives and livelihoods take a hit in the weeks ahead.ßWatch this. It shows why we should all do the right thing and stay home to the fullest extent possible. All of us can help slow the spread of the virus, protecting the elderly, the vulnerable, and each other. https://t.co/FgffQrMVB7ßA shout out to Kevin, Giannis, Zion, Blake, Steph and all the players, owners and organizations who are setting a good example during a challenging time. A reminder that we’re a community, and that each of us has an obligation to look out for each other. https://t.co/cv1RZi9GGLßIf you’re wondering whether it’s an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here’s a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives. We have to look out for each other. https://t.co/Ld7Uc8sPTQßIn the midst of campaign season, it’s important to look squarely at what’s at stake. This article speaks to one of the disturbing long term trends that we as voters and citizens need to expect our government to address. https://t.co/m49rbES0i6ß55 years ago, when a group of civil rights organizers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they carried America with them. Today, let's honor that legacy by continuing their work to protect and exercise our foundational right to vote. https://t.co/zhMeTA3kFjßProtect yourself and your community from coronavirus with common sense precautions: wash your hands, stay home when sick and listen to the @CDCgov and local health authorities.

Our hearts are with you and the first responders working so diligently to protect the vibrant communities of Nashville.ßAmerica needs you as states prepare for the next round of redistricting.

All across this country, right now, people are coming together to create extraordinary change. https://t.co/YTTfJYrYXWßAfter a lifetime of reaching for the stars, today, Katherine Johnson landed among them. She spent decades as a hidden figure, breaking barriers behind the scenes. But by the end of her life, she had become a hero to millions—including Michelle and me. https://t.co/isG29nwBiBßHappy birthday to one of my heroes — someone who believed our right to vote was more important than his own life. Thanks for making good trouble for 80 years, @repjohnlewis. https://t.co/LqMuvmpbLpßhttps://t.co/AQJsfBf0rißHere are a couple of articles that are worth reading — from housing to health, these stories use data to explore challenges we face and demonstrate how policy solutions along with civic engagement can make a real difference in people’s lives.
https://t.co/G6EIUwuMqVßEleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history. https://t.co/BmdXrxUAUfßHappy Valentine’s Day to my forever dance partner, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/lHvTGUwEHrßWhat a great example of citizenship, what each of us can do to make a difference for all of us: https://t.co/YxsvONUuVlßEven if the methods are new, sowing the seeds of doubt, division, and discord to turn Americans against each other is an old trick. The antidote is citizenship: to get engaged, organized, mobilized, and to vote - on every level, in every election. https://t.co/yOvaCZYtrWßThirty years on, I remember the hope we all felt watching Mandela’s release from prison. The gift of a new way of seeing. The chance to participate in the work of building a better world.

Glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the Oscar for Higher Ground’s first release. https://t.co/W4AZ68iWoYßSixty years ago today, the Greensboro Four stood up to injustice by sitting down at a lunch counter. Our journey is full of such stories; of acts of patriotic protest that challenge this country we love to live up to our highest ideals, however long it takes. #BlackHistoryMonthßKobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act. To lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.ßEvery so often, I re-read Dr. King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail. While some of the injustices may have changed, his poetic brilliance, moral clarity, and tests of conscience still reverberate today. Take a moment to reflect on his righteous call: https://t.co/oBdqFqdWA6ßIn every scene, you are my star, @MichelleObama! Happy birthday, baby! https://t.co/hgMBhHasBjßGlad to see American Factory’s Oscar nod for Best Documentary. It’s the kind of story we don’t see often enough and it’s exactly what Michelle and I hope to achieve with Higher Ground. Congrats to the incredible filmmakers and entire team!ßOur fellow Americans in Puerto Rico can use our support after this week’s earthquakes. They’ve shown their enduring spirit over the past couple years, and it’s up to us to pull together for one another once again. I hope you’ll support their recovery: https://t.co/rYhSb8uVXKßHere’s the thing: Even with problems of this magnitude, each of us can still find a way to make change. That’s why I’m proud of young people like Alice Mahar, a environmental activist in Melbourne. Read about her and find ways you can help, too: https://t.co/qAHFiBgw6bßThe catastrophic fires in Australia are the latest example of the very real and very urgent consequences of climate change.

Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bvßTake a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering.

The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.ßJust 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3CßThat’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2ßJermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.
https://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0ßBahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPHßAs we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDlßMarca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIsßYesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaItßSaw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it—keep it up, David! That’s some creative organizing.

Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxzßA good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground. And it’s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground’s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFVßToni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9tßUntil all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xoßhttps://t.co/nNOVtQ50O4ßThe families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQRßRecent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa https://t.co/mEbwKCDUiPßHere’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.” https://t.co/tpdMZ9hJoEßI’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better. https://t.co/0cfDltjuePßEconomist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it.

Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtGß#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fKgrVRiHhcßI have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud.

A great performance from a great team—looking forward to Sunday. #OneNationOneTeamßNo one changes the world alone. That’s why the @ObamaFoundation is connecting emerging leaders from South Africa to Singapore to the South Side of Chicago—so they can change the world together. Read my reflection on our second year: https://t.co/ly3en2Neu4ßThe most important job in our democracy is citizen. If you’re tired of politicians manipulating maps and ignoring the will of voters, I hope you’ll sign @allontheline’s Citizen Commitment today: https://t.co/CUAaoAGY6zß50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement.

I’m as grateful for her life advice as I am impressed by her 100-meter dash time. https://t.co/8lc9CimqytßNow we’re talking! Congrats to Team USA for moving on, and thanks for continuing to make us all proud. #USA https://t.co/DVkKBfU6wAßOn Juneteenth, we celebrate our capacity to make real the promise of our founding, that thing inside each of us that says America is not yet finished, that compels all of us to fight for justice and equality until this country we love more closely aligns with our highest ideals. https://t.co/2XAKRuRrbGßOutside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3ßThis is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4ußYes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8ßHappy Father’s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers’ Uplift. Today, we’re celebrating fathers like these who provide a powerful example—not only for their kids, but for the rest of us, too. https://t.co/GJsxi8DozYßThe @USWNT is something to smile about.

Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/AHcHGATy5SßSix years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing.

Thanks for everything you do to make this country a little more equal. Turban looks great, by the way. Happy Pride Month, everybody! https://t.co/SO7mgnOkglßWhat a life.

Two years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS and launched @iamalsorg to find a cure. Brian and Sandra wake up every day believing that we can win this fight—and that makes me hopeful, too. https://t.co/eETCgFnLgPßExciting to see the faces of Colombia's future at an @ObamaFoundation roundtable with young leaders in Bogotá.

I'm proud of every student out there who's taking the next step in their education. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. https://t.co/SZQaUG2ZzeßCondolences to the family of John Singleton.

I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4ßThis generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world.

I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEIßI met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month.
